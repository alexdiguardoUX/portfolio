                <h2>In a nutshell...</h2>  
                <p>    
                    <strong>Opportunity & Business goal:</strong>
                    Research suggests that users are not necessarily loyal to a specific price comparison website. <strong>Our main goal was to increase the number of purchases per user</strong>, thereby establish greater loyalty.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>My approach:</strong>
                    Starting from a vague idea coming from the Customer Proposition Team, <strong>I led and executed the design vision of the reward experience</strong> by applying the end-to-end process.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Success metrics:</strong> 
                    <strong>From 1 to 2 purchases per user</strong>, with 900k joined members generating 1+ million sales.</li><br>
                    <br>

                <p>I partnered with our Marketing Directors, Product Managers and Tech to run a workshop. In the session, we brainstormed, debated, and finally laid down the 'core proposition'.<br><br>
                   <strong>The initiative:</strong> The core proposition was to reward customers after a purchase or for referring friends. The amounts would vary based on the products and would be added to the wallet balance.
                   On top of that, we wanted to offer some discount codes when shopping at popular brands.<br><br>
                   For post-MVP, we would explore initiatives like free days out and cashback.<br><br>

                <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Face-to-Face user interviews + Card Sort.<br><br>
                    10 enthusiastic participants were invited at our Manchester offices, eager to share insights about their favourite reward programs. This face-to-face engagement allowed us to delve deeper into their preferences and experiences.<br><br>
                   <strong>Key learnings:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most loyalty programs are for stores and supermarkets</li> 
                    <li>Low awareness on reward programs in the Price Comparison Websites (PCW) world</li> 
                    <li>The few participants who knew about PCW reward programs were mostly aware of free cinema tickets</li> 
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Top 10 rewards:</strong><br>
                    A card sort with a bigger group of 30 participants was carried out to discover the most desired rewards which will give us a better indication of <strong>desirability</strong>.<br><br>

                    <strong>Gamification</strong>, with ideas like the 'Wheel of Fortune' and 'Weekly Challenges,' added an exciting twist. Though intriguing, these features were initially deemed 'nice to have' and fell outside our primary scope.
