                <p>
                    <strong>The narrative:</strong> You might have caught a glimpse of the SuperSaveClub ad on TV or YouTube. This rewards program was MoneySuperMarket's bold move to enhance user engagement. Starting with a vague idea, I creatively shaped it into a concrete concept, bringing smiles to our stakeholders and users' faces.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>When:</strong> 2022 - 2024<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>My responsibilities:</strong>
                </p>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lead designer for the mobile app</li> 
                        <li>Strategy & Planning</li> 
                        <li>Foundational Research</li> 
                        <li>Wireframing / Prototyping</li>
                        <li>UI Design</li>
                        <li>Usability Testing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Others involved:</strong></p>

                        <li>External Brand Design Agency</li> 
                        <li>Content Strategy</li> 
                    </ul>
                <p>    
                    <strong>Business goal:</strong> Research suggests that users are not necessarily loyal to a specific price comparison website. Our main goal was to increase returning customers, thereby establishing greater loyalty.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Success metrics:</strong> 
                    Within 12 months, we reached 280k members, going up to <strong>900k members</strong> in 2024, generating <strong>1 million sales</strong>.</li>

                <h3>The strategy to set us for success</h3>
                <p>I partnered with our Marketing Directors, Product Managers and Tech to run a workshop. In the session, we brainstormed, debated, and finally laid down the 'core proposition'.<br><br>
                   <strong>In a nutshell:</strong> The core proposition was to reward customers after a purchase or for referring friends. The amounts would vary based on the products and would be added to the wallet balance.
                   On top of that, we wanted to offer some discount codes when shopping at popular brands.<br><br>
                   For post-MVP, we would explore initiatives like cashback.<br><br>

                    10 enthusiastic participants were invited at our Manchester offices, eager to share insights about their favourite reward programs. This face-to-face engagement allowed us to delve deeper into their preferences and experiences.<br><br>
                   <strong>Key learnings:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most loyalty programs are for stores and supermarkets</li>

                    <li>The few participants who knew about PCW reward programs were mostly aware of free cinema tickets</li> 
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Top 10 rewards:</strong><br>
                    A card sort with a bigger group of 30 participants was carried out to discover the most desired rewards which will give us a better indication of <strong>desirability</strong>.<br><br>

                    <strong>Gamification</strong>, with ideas like the 'Wheel of Fortune' and 'Weekly Challenges,' added an exciting twist. Though intriguing, these features were initially deemed 'nice to have' and fell outside our primary scope.
