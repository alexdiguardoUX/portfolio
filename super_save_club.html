                <h2>In a nutshell...</h2>  
                <p>    
                    <strong>🎯 Opportunity & Business goal:</strong><br>
                    Research suggests users are not loyal to a specific price comparison website. The primary business goal was to <strong>increase purchases per user</strong>, shifting behaviour from one-off, price driven visits to repeat engagement.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    <strong>💡 My approach:</strong><br>
                    Starting from a vague brief, <strong>I led and executed the design vision for the reward experience</strong>, from problem framing and research through concept definition, validation, and launch.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    <strong>📈 Success metrics:</strong><br>
                    • 2 purchases per user (vs 1 before)<br>
                    • 1 million members reached in 2 years
                </p>

                <h3>Defining the core proposition</h3>
                <p>I facilitated an in-person workshop with senior stakeholders to align on the core elements of the SuperSaveClub.<br><br>
                    <strong>4 core questions</strong> emerged that directly shaped the product strategy:
                    <ul>
                        <li>❓ How do users find out about the SuperSaveClub?</li>
                        <li>❓ Where can users access it?</li>                     
                        <li>❓ How will users earn rewards?</li>
                        <li>❓ What do users get in return?</li>

                 <p>We evaluated multiple reward providers against these criteria. <strong>GiftCloud</strong> emerged as the strongest option due the variety of rewards and ability to support the above.<br><br>

                    <strong>What stakeholders wanted:</strong> Lead with “Free Days Out” as the primary reward mechanism.<br><br>
                    <strong>Why I pushed back:</strong> Free Days Out didn’t support long-term monetisation, it was just a free give away, so I strongly recommended positioning “Buy More, Get More" as the main mechanism, while using Free Days Out as an onboarding hook to drive initial adoption.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>This trade-off led to a reward structure that balanced user appeal with long-term business sustainability.</strong>

                    <strong>Methodology:</strong> Survey - 100 participants who use comparison sites. <br><br>
                    <strong>Key learnings:</strong> A significant number of users don’t have a preferred comparison site. The majority rely on the first results provided by Google and prioritise the cheapest prices.<br><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Key decisions:</strong> Based on a Top 10 generated during a Card Sort with 50 users, I recommended leading with gift cards from Amazon, restaurants and supermarkets.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>What was unexpected:</strong>  Free Days Out scored quite low, however I recommended testing it, as it was an easy "plug & play" integration offered by GiftCloud.<br><br>

                    <strong>Outcome:</strong> After launch, Amazon proved to be the most popular gift card, followed by Sainsbury's and JustEat. Free Days Out also demonstrated to be a compelling feature thanks to the variety of attractions.<br><br>

                    A key decision I made which influenced the development phases was to start with a few products rather than the full list of 25 products. Sales data helped identifying the 4 most popular ones.

                <p>
                    <strong>What failed: </strong>Discount codes consistently showed low engagement. Follow-up surveys revealed that many partner brands were unfamiliar or not perceived as relevant. Based on these findings, I recommended moving away from generic discount codes and towards more personalised offers. <br><br>
                    <strong>What I would do differently: </strong>Given the consistently high engagement with cashback, I would push harder to prioritise this earlier over discount codes and refer a friend.<br><br>
                    <strong>What I've learned: </strong>This project reinforced my belief that rewards should be sequenced, not stacked. Introducing too many earning mechanisms before users understand the core value creates friction and slows long-term growth.<br><br>
