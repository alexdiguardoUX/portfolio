                <p>
                    <strong>The narrative:</strong> We live in an era where business opportunities are almost endless. For a car rental company with hundreds of affiliates, offering white-labelled products to airlines, hotels, and other businesses in the travel industry can turn into a gold mine.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Business goal:</strong> Increase affiliates retention and attract new businesses to join our affiliate program by modernising outdated solutions.<br>
                    <br>
                    <!-- <strong>Brief:</strong> The design of the current affiliate system is outdated and some features offered across brands are inconsistent. Design a new themable framework which all affiliated brands will sit on with their own look and feel.<br><br> -->
                    <strong>Success metrics:</strong> 
                    The solution attracted big brands like Jet2 and Ryanair which generated a total of<strong> 370k bookings</strong> between 2019-2020 (pre-covid).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Most participants recognised the affiliates' brand without showing the logo</li>
                    <li>Most participants completed the tasks with minor issues</li>
                    <li>Few participants were confused as they didn't know some brands also offered car rentals</li>
                    <li>Some participants said they expect to see a "strikethrough" price if a special offer is applied</li>
                    <li>All participants think the design is clean and appealing</li>
