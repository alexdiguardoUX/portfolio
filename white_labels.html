            <h1>Multi-Brand Car Rental Platform for Affiliates</h1>
            <h2>A new framework which different brands can adopt to offer an online car rental booking system</h2>
            <section class="project-overview">
                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Context:</strong> One of the travel brands I worked for offers an affiliation program that allows affiliated companies to provide their customers with a car rental booking system under their own brand.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>When:</strong> 2021 <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>My responsibilities:</strong>
                </p>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Research</li> 
                        <li>UI Design</li> 
                        <li>Prototyping</li> 
                        <li>Usability Testing</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>    
                    <strong>Business goal:</strong> Increase affiliates retention and attract new businesses to join our affiliate program.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Challenge prompt:</strong> The design of the current affiliate system is outdated and some features offered across brands are inconsistent. Design a new themable framework which all affiliated brands will sit on with their own look and feel.<br><br>
                    <strong>Success metrics so far:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brand representation: <strong>4/5</strong> (scored by affiliates)</li> 
                        <li>Quality of design: <strong>5/5</strong> (scored by affiliates and test participants)</li> 
                        <li>Clarity of information: <strong>4/5</strong> (scored by test participants)</li> 
                        <li>Tasks success rate: <strong>Success with minor issue</strong> (scored by me)</li>

                <p>Foundational user research was conducted with some of our biggest B2B affiliate representatives to understand their needs, goals and struggles.<br><br>
                   The key question was: <strong>"What is important for your brand to have on a car rental platform?".</strong><br><br>

                <h3>What should I focus on first?</h3>
                <p>Using an <strong>"Impact / Effort"</strong> matrix I established which themes to focus on for the first iteration. Even if considered as high impact, <strong>"Control over customisations" was left out</strong> as it will require a product of its own which would empower affiliates to directly apply changes on the site.<br><br>
                Developers and Management also agreed on this classification.</p><br>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Custom Header:</strong> The affiliate can provide their own header to reinforce their brand presence and advertise other services they might offer</li>
                    <li><strong>Hero Section:</strong> Unnecessary distractions in the background of the image are removed so that it gives more legibility to the content. A tinted overlay will be applied to restore the natural color of the sky</li>
                    <li><strong>Promotional Content:</strong> When needed, the banner component can be enabled to display promotions. The image can be provided by the affiliate following our dimensions guidelines</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Footer:</strong> Similar to  the custom header, this will feature useful links</li>
