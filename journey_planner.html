                <p>
                    <strong>Context:</strong> One of the topics in the 2022 roadmap for the GMCA (Greater Manchester Combined Authority) is about sustainability, so to <strong>reduce the emissions of CO2 by encouraging more people to use public transport</strong> instead of driving.<br>
                    <p>    
                        <strong>Challenge prompt:</strong> While the GMCA is planning on deploying more eco-friendly buses, <strong>I took the initiative of exploring a concept for a digital solution that would improve the public transport experience.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>

                   <strong>Secondary Research Findings:<br><br>
                   Good start! As of 2019, the majority of commuters are using public transport, although the city is wasting space and resources in unused car parks instead of investing into public transport.<br><br></strong>
                   <i>“Roads and car parks take up a whopping 59% of total transport infrastructure surface area in Manchester,” says property analyst Ed Howe, but “only 13% of the daily journeys into and out of the city center are made by car.”</i><br><br>

                <p><strong>However, what's not good is that 23% of people will quit a job because the commute is too stressful.</strong>

                    <strong>Survey finding:</strong><br><br>
                    20 participants who regularly commute to Manchester by either bus, tram or train were recruited from "Mint Manchester" Facebook group to gather their pain points.<br><br>
                    Here are some examples which were categorised using an affinity map:

                <p><strong>Take away:</strong> Google Maps seems to offer a more complete range of useful features that cover commuters pain points, however <strong>there are common points amongst competitors that suggest a gap in features that could make commuters' life much easier.</strong></p><br>
